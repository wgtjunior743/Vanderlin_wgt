BLOOD IS MEAT AND MEAT IS GLORY!
GRAGGAR FEEDS THROUGH ME!
TEAR! BITE! CHEW! SCREAM!
HUNGER NEVER ENDS! NEVER!
I WANT TO HEAR YOUR BONES CRACK!
YOUR FEAR IS A SEASONING!
FLESH IS A FEAST, LIFE IS A MEAL!
I WILL DRINK YOUR WARMTH!
GRAGGAR! FILL MY BELLY WITH WAR!
EORAâ€™S TEARS TASTE SWEET!
YOUR GOD CANNOT SAVE YOUR TENDER MEAT!
CHEW THE WEAK! SPIT THE BONES!
WE FEAST UNTIL WE BURST!
I SMELL LIFE! I SMELL DINNER!
YOUR SCREAMS ARE MY GRACE!
GRAGGAR GRAGGAR GRAGGAR!
I AM STARVED AND THE WORLD IS MY PLATTER!
THE GREEN BLOOM COMES FOR YOU!
EVERYTHING THAT BREATHES BELONGS TO THE FEAST!
