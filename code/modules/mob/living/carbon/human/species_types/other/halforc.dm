	\n\n\
	Half-Orcs are the offspring of orcs and another species, half-orcs, \
	or another species who has consumed much kinsflesh on their way to orcishness. \
	An outsider cannot tell a half-orc product of heritage or cannibalism at a glance, leading to much social ostracization.\
	\n\n\
	Due to their parent's refusal to nurture them, \
	as well as their other parent often rejecting or attacking them, most Half-Orcs will grow as orphans. \
	Their rejection by the rest of society causes their growth to stunt, \
	often making them hostile and prone to violence. Because of this, most will assume the worst in them, \
	believing that they are cursed to follow their orcish parent's footsteps in the gorging of kin-flesh. \
	\n\n\
	A Half-Orc may display Orcish features, sporting tusks and natural strength. \
	Many are nigh-indistinguishable visually from full orcs, save for their remaining grasp on self-control.\
