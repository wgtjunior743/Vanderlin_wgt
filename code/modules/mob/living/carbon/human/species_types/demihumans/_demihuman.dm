	desc = "Hollowkin are short lived, widely diverse, and have an insatiable hatred for dark elves. \
	This hate stems from their long standing political neighbor and rival, \
	the Zizonic dark-elven kingdoms of Subterra. \
	Dendor and Xylix stand as the 'patron-deities' of this species despite having no hand in their creation. \
	Hollowkin view freedom to be of the upmost importance due to their dark-elven neighbors' tendencies toward slavery and their own history of subjugation. \
	They also, often mistakenly, worship Dendor for the boon of their animalistic nature, perceiving him as the source of their traits, talents, and instinct. \
	\n\n\
	Their true origin is much darker. Hollowkin are the product of dark-elven ingenuity and fleshcrafting. \
	Their creation is a simple story of malice and greed- of sapient animal hybrid slave homunculi, \
	a person turned product which they could market and sell to other great houses of modern Zizonic Subterra. \
	The true nature of their existence is largely lost to the hollowkin through centuries. \
	The dark elves still recall, of course, viciously mocking their creations from deep within their caves, \
	declaring them but nothing more than animals or pets. \
	Hollowkin react violently to dark-elven attempts at oppression, this leads to conflicts across the world of Psydonia. \
	\n\n\
	To the unaligned observer, hollowkin are often seen amongst bandit bands, working openly with Agents of Matthios, \
	conflating the idea of freedom between the two deities. There is, of course, the old wives' tales that circulate... \
	how hollowkin lead to infestations of Werewolves. Hollowkin are often denied nobility from this rumour alone. \
	Whether this is true or not is unknown to the common person, \
	but to those familiar with the horrendous magics used by the dark elves, they must only assume the worst. \
	\n\n\
	THIS IS A DISCRIMINATED SPECIES. EXPECT A MORE DIFFICULT EXPERIENCE. PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK."
