	A proud and robust species of vertically challenged folk, \
	dwarves are known for their martial strength \
	and their tenacity towards their ancient customs of craft and honour. \
	Dwarves hold a strong alliance with humenkind and have done so throughout history, as was their original purpose decreed by Psydon. \
	A Dwarf, much like the rock that they carve their fortress out of, is stubborn and ancient. \
	\n\n\
	They are revered craftsmen, sculptors, smiths, and miners. \
	As an old and mostly out-of-date saying goes, \"If you want it done right, lose 2 feet and grow a beard.\" \
	\n\n\
	Despite their cultural praise, a long-standing feud remains between dwarves and elves \
	stemming from old industrial practices."

/*
To make this work poison on_mob_life needs to have the dwarf modifier in it. Relevant when adding new ones.
The more specialized/expensive poison the less effect the resistance.

For common natural poisons (berrypoison) = effect reduced by 2/3, half nausea
For manufactured poisones = effect reduced by half or so

Note: Its not meant to protect against every dangerous/bad reagent, its supposed to be just poisons, making it meaningful against most common reagent hazards but not full protection.
