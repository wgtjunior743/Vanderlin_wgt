	desc = "The Children of Abyssor, also known as Tritons or their colloquial name, \"Deep Folk,\" \
	are a strange species of people that live under the waves of Psydonia. \
	Born from creatures of the deep with Abyssor's guidance, \
	these aquatic wayfarers all share a few common traits. \
	Similar to other creatures that dwell below the surface, their eyes are dull with disuse. \
	Tritons feel pain when gazing upon that which direct light of Astrata herself illuminates. \
	\n\n\
	Unlike most of the people of Psydonia, their culture is often considered cold and dour; \
	an apathetic attitude to most negative or positive news. For them, the depths of Psydonias oceans are cold and unforgiving. \
	Large beasts travel the waters that swallow their kin whole... \
	but the crushing depths have provided them a hearty disposition and resistance to most threats. \
	Born of Abyssor, their normally placid emotions can swing into a wild rage when they view injustice done upon their kin at the hands of a sapient being. \
	\n\n\
	Tritons seen on the surface are very important trade partners, mercenaries, and surprising academics. \
	Merchants often spend vast amounts of coin to have them aboard their trade vessels, fending off pirates or guiding their boats through turbulent weather. \
	Be it on or within the sea, they excel- on land, however, they struggle. \
	With their awkward and gangly fins, long, sharp talons, ghastly, lipless teeth, \
	and milky, foreign eyes, they seem unfit to walk amongst the people. Humen children are often afraid of them due to such appearances. \
	\n\n\
	Their species is not without its tribalism, however. Large sections of their kin have broken away form their father, \
	to consider themselves Noc's chosen. Due to their extreme sexual dimorphism similar to that of the common angler, \
	males of this species are more likely to pursue magick with their weaker frames compared to their stronger female counterparts."
