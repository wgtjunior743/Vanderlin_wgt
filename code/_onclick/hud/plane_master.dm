 * Emissive overlays and emissive blockers are put onto the same plane.
 * The layers for the emissive overlays and emissive blockers cause them to mask eachother similar to normal BYOND objects.
 * A color matrix filter is applied to the emissive plane to mask out anything that isn't whatever the emissive color is.
 * This is then used to alpha mask the lighting plane.
